# Zerion Wallet Extension

Work in progress

### Local testing

To install the extension for local testing,

1. [Download the archive](https://github.com/zeriontech/zerion-wallet-extension/archive/refs/heads/builds.zip)
2. Uncompress it
3. Open this url in chrome: chrome://extensions/
4. Enable "Developer mode" (top right corner)
5. Press "Load unpacked" button (top left)
6. Select the uncompressed "list" folder
7. The extension should be enabled now. You might see the "Errors" button on the page, that is expected and has to do with chrome forcing another manifest.json version on developers. Make sure to reload the dapp page you want to test it on after adding the extension.
